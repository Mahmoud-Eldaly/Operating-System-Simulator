 ## Interpreter, Mutexes, and Process Scheduler Implementation
 The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive system that includes an interpreter for executing code stored in text files, mutexes to ensure mutual exclusion over critical resources, and a scheduler to efficiently manage processes within the system.

The primary component of the system is the interpreter. It will be designed to read and interpret code from text files. The interpreter will analyze the code, execute the instructions, and produce the desired outcomes. This functionality enables the system to process and execute various scripts or programs, providing a dynamic environment for code execution.

To ensure the integrity and proper functioning of the system, the implementation will also include mutexes. Mutexes are synchronization mechanisms used to control access to critical resources. By implementing mutexes, the system will prevent multiple processes from accessing critical resources simultaneously, thereby avoiding conflicts and maintaining data consistency.

Furthermore, this project will incorporate a scheduler that manages the processes within the system. The scheduler will allocate system resources effectively and allocate CPU time to various processes in an optimal manner. By implementing a scheduler, the system will be capable of managing multiple processes concurrently, maximizing system utilization and ensuring fair execution of tasks.

The combined implementation of the interpreter, mutexes, and process scheduler will create a robust and efficient system capable of reading and executing code stored in text files, managing critical resources through mutual exclusion, and scheduling processes effectively. This system will provide a reliable platform for running programs, ensuring proper resource allocation, and facilitating the smooth execution of various tasks.
